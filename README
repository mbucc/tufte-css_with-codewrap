There was a long and informative thread on PR #90 for tufte-css project 
(https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css/pull/90).

In the end, the author decided not to include the code wrapping CSS.  This
patch applies that wrapping to tufte-css style.

For an example of how the styling changes, see before.png and after.png.
