There was a long and informative thread on PR #90 for tufte-css project 
(https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css/pull/90).

In the end, the author decided not to include the code wrapping CSS.  This
patch applies the line wrapping logic of @adamschwartz to tufte-css style.
This is Adam's code verbatim with a single change: the line-height settings
are changed to match the smaller code font height that eventually got 
committed.

For an example of how the styling changes, see before.png and after.png.
These show a screenshot of a very narrow Chrome window with code that is
longer than the window width.

	v1.1 applies to 1.1 tag in tufte-css
	HEAD should apply to current master
